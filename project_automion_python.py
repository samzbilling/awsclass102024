Objective
Enhance the AWS Lambda function to automate tasks involving S3, DynamoDB, SNS, SES, and CloudWatch. The function will:

Trigger on S3 file uploads.
Process file metadata and store it in DynamoDB.
Notify via SNS about new file uploads.
Send an email report using SES.
Log events in CloudWatch for monitoring.


AWS Services Overview
S3: Source of event triggers.
DynamoDB: Store processed file metadata.
SNS (Simple Notification Service): Send notifications to subscribers (e.g., email, SMS).
SES (Simple Email Service): Send detailed email reports.
CloudWatch: Monitor and log function execution.
  
Steps to Code
1. S3 Integration
Trigger Lambda when a file is uploaded.
Parse the event payload to get bucket name and file details.
Retrieve additional file metadata using the S3 head_object API.
  
2. DynamoDB Integration
Create a table (e.g., FileMetadataTable) with attributes like FileName, BucketName, and ContentType.
Use the DynamoDB client to insert metadata about the uploaded file.
  
3. SNS Integration
Create an SNS topic (e.g., FileUploadNotifications).
Add subscribers to the topic (e.g., email or SMS).
In the Lambda function, publish a message to the SNS topic about the uploaded file.
Comments for Code:
# Use boto3.client('sns') to publish a message to the SNS topic
# Include details like file name and bucket name in the message
# Make sure the Lambda role has 'sns:Publish' permissions
4. SES Integration
Configure SES to send emails (ensure the email address is verified in SES for sandbox environments).
Compose an email report containing file details and metadata.
Use SES to send the email to stakeholders.
Comments for Code:
# Use boto3.client('ses') to send an email
# Specify sender and recipient email addresses
# Include file metadata in the email body
# Ensure the Lambda role has 'ses:SendEmail' permissions
5. CloudWatch Integration
Add logging statements for each key step (e.g., S3 event received, DynamoDB insertion, SNS message sent).
Use print() or logging for monitoring.
Monitor the Lambda functionâ€™s execution logs in CloudWatch.
                      
Comments for Code:
# Use the logging module to log events at each step
# Example: logging.info("Successfully processed file: %s", file_name)
# View logs in the CloudWatch console for debugging and monitoring

Part 2: Query Data with Athena


Create an S3 Data Catalog:
Use Athena to point to the S3 bucket where the CSV or split files are stored.
Define the schema for querying the data.
Perform SQL queries on the data:

Hints:


# Use the Athena console or boto3.client('athena') to execute SQL queries
# Set up an S3 bucket for Athena query results
# Example query: SELECT Category, SUM(Total) AS TotalSales FROM "sales_data_table" GROUP BY Category;
Step 6: Visualize Data in QuickSight


Connect QuickSight to Athena:
Create a new data source pointing to the Athena table.
Build dashboards:
Visualize total sales by category, trends over time, and top products/customers.
Hints:

- Set up QuickSight permissions for S3 and Athena access.
- Use QuickSight's drag-and-drop interface to create visualizations.
- Example: Bar chart for sales by category, line chart for sales trends over time.
                      

Set up AWS Resources:

Create an S3 bucket.
Create a DynamoDB table.
Set up SNS and SES configurations.
Ensure your Lambda function has proper permissions.
Write Lambda Code:

Start with S3 integration and gradually add DynamoDB, SNS, SES, and CloudWatch functionality.
Follow the comments and hints provided to structure your function.
Deploy and Test:

Deploy the Lambda function and test by uploading files to the S3 bucket.
Verify the file metadata is stored in DynamoDB, notifications are sent via SNS, and email reports are sent via SES.
Monitor Logs:

Check CloudWatch logs to ensure the function executed as expected.
Identify and fix any issues logged in CloudWatch.

- Set up QuickSight permissions for S3 and Athena access.
- Use QuickSight's drag-and-drop interface to create visualizations.
- Example: Bar chart for sales by category, line chart for sales trends over time.


STEP BY STEP SUMMARY GUIDE 



                                                      Part 1: Automate File Processing with Lambda
Step 1: Set Up AWS Resources
S3 Bucket:

Create an S3 bucket (e.g., my-file-processing-bucket).
Enable event notifications for PutObject events (when a file is uploaded).
Add a folder (optional) to organize uploaded files.
DynamoDB Table:

Create a table named FileMetadataTable.
Primary key: FileName (String).
Additional attributes: BucketName, ContentType, FileSize, and LastModified.
SNS Topic:

Create an SNS topic (e.g., FileUploadNotifications).
Add at least one email subscriber to the topic.
SES Configuration:

Verify email addresses (sender and recipients) in SES if working in sandbox mode.
IAM Role:

Assign your Lambda function a role with the following permissions:
s3:GetObject
dynamodb:PutItem
sns:Publish
ses:SendEmail
logs:CreateLogStream and logs:PutLogEvents for CloudWatch.
Step 2: Write and Configure Lambda Function
Function Workflow:

Trigger Lambda when a file is uploaded to S3.
Extract metadata about the file (e.g., name, size, content type).
Store metadata in DynamoDB.
Send an SNS notification about the file upload.
Send a detailed email report using SES.
Log all events in CloudWatch.
Implementation Steps:

S3 Integration:

Parse the event to retrieve bucket name and file details.
Use the head_object API to get metadata.
DynamoDB Integration:

Store file metadata in the FileMetadataTable.
SNS Integration:

Publish a notification to the SNS topic with file details.
SES Integration:

Compose an email with file metadata and send it via SES.
CloudWatch Integration:

Add log statements for debugging and monitoring.
Step 3: Deploy and Test
Deploy the Lambda function.
Upload a file to the S3 bucket.
Verify the following:
File metadata is stored in DynamoDB.
An SNS notification is sent to subscribers.
An email report is received via SES.
Logs are available in CloudWatch.
Part 2: Query Data with Athena
Step 4: Configure Athena
Set Up an S3 Data Catalog:

Configure Athena to query the S3 bucket where files are stored.
Define the schema based on the file structure (e.g., CSV headers).
Perform SQL Queries:

Use queries to analyze the data, such as:
sql
Copy code
SELECT Category, SUM(Total) AS TotalSales
FROM sales_data_table
GROUP BY Category;
Step 5: Optimize for Real-Time Queries
Integrate AWS Glue for ETL tasks to prepare data for Athena.
Store query results in an S3 bucket.
Part 3: Visualize Data in QuickSight
Step 6: Connect QuickSight to Athena
Set up a new QuickSight data source linked to Athena.
Build datasets based on Athena queries.
Step 7: Create Dashboards
Use the drag-and-drop interface to create:
Bar charts for sales by category.
Line charts for trends over time.
Top 10 customers or products.
